Scientific Computing with Python
================================

This workshop was on using Python, the IPython notebook, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.

### REQUIREMENTS: 

[Python 2.X (NOT Python 3)](http://www.python.org/)

[IPython 0.13](http://ipython.org/)

[NumPy + SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy)

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html)

You can also use the [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php) which will install all the necessary libraries and packages for you.

### Launching the IPython Notebook

Open a terminal (command prompt in Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to work; this is where your notebook files will be stored.

To launch the notebook, simply enter:

    >ipython notebook

To launch the notebook with inline plotting, enter:

    >ipython notebook --pylab inline


To view IPython notebooks hosted online (e.g. in this GitHub repository), use the [IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
